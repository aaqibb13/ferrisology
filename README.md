# Project Initialization
This repository was initialized using Cargo, which is Rustâ€™s build system and package manager. According to ferrisology, most people use this tool to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you, which include building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries. (We call the libraries that your code needs dependencies)
